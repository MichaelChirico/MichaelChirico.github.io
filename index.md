## R Packages

* [`funchir`](https://github.com/MichaelChirico/funchir): convenience functions. I may or may not eventually push to CRAN.

* [`texr`](https://github.com/MichaelChirico/texr): simple, robust interface for converting R objects into TeX tables, etc. Very early-stage.

## Miscellany

* [All-Time MLB Home Run Leaders](https://michaelchirico.shinyapps.io/home_runs/): I made a `shiny` app which depicts, for a chosen year, the make-up of the top-ten list in the MLB for all-time home runs, and the trajectory of how each player's HR count evolved over the course of their career. The code for this is [here](https://github.com/MichaelChirico/assorted_code/tree/master/home_runs).

* [Competitiveness of Major Sports Leagues](http://imgur.com/dy8ym3Y): Using the Gini coefficient on win percentages within a season (recorded from a web scraping exercise) to quantify the evolution over time of the competitiveness of each of the four major sports leagues in the USA -- NFL, MLB, NBA, and NHL. Code [here](https://github.com/MichaelChirico/assorted_code/blob/master/sports_gini.R).
